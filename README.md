# town-of-salem-tool

This is a small bookmarklet widget that allows extremely fast recording of:
- Votes and vote history for all players
- Suspicious players
- Good/evil player roles

It functions by generating a transparent widget that overlays the main play area
and augments the UI.

I'm developing it exclusively for a friend so there are currently no docs at all.
My friend may record a screencast on how to use it at some point, and I'll post that here if so.

## Installation

In case you want to figure out your own system of using it without any instructions, you can install it by copying the code in the bookmarklet file (under /dist) to a new bookmark in your browser of choice and prepending javascript: to it (thus making the bookmark's url read `javascript:((function(){...`)
